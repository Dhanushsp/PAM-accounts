# Sales Functionality Fix

## Problem
The application was showing "failed to fetch sales data" error because:
1. The backend only had a POST endpoint for creating sales
2. There was no GET endpoint to fetch sales data
3. No dedicated Sales page existed for viewing and filtering sales

## Solution

### Backend Changes (`backend/routes/sales.js`)
Added new GET endpoints:

1. **GET `/api/sales`** - Fetch all sales with filtering options:
   - `customerId` - Filter by specific customer
   - `fromDate` - Filter from date (YYYY-MM-DD)
   - `toDate` - Filter to date (YYYY-MM-DD)
   - `saleType` - Filter by sale type (kg/pack)
   - `paymentMethod` - Filter by payment method (cash/online)
   - `limit` - Number of results per page (default: 50)
   - `page` - Page number (default: 1)

2. **GET `/api/sales/summary`** - Get sales statistics:
   - Total sales count
   - Total revenue
   - Total amount received
   - Sales breakdown by type
   - Sales breakdown by payment method

3. **GET `/api/sales/:id`** - Get specific sale by ID

### Frontend Changes

  - Date range filtering
